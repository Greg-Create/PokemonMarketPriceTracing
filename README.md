# PokemonMarketPriceTracing

This is a website/tool that I made that tracks the accurate market prices of pokemon cards. After inuting a card the application calculates the market price of the card by
going through ebay-sold listings elimating all the ones that don't match the card and creating a profile for the card which is than stored in a mongodb databse.
